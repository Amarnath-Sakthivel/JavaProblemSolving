# ASCII_DIGITS

This is a Program which I was faced in mettl test. This platform is more useful for testing by yourself.

Mettl platform: Database Programmer Scoring. ... Mettl's flexible platform lets you thoroughly evaluate database programmers before making a hiring decision. Our hands-on assessments test candidate application of database queries by requiring them to match specific outputs.

    Program Description:
                    Find the sum: Uncommon Alphabets- UpperCase
                    Given two characters input1[] and input2[] which contains only uppercase alphabets.
                    
                    Step 1: Extract the alphabets which are present only in any one of the array(Uncommon Alphabets).
                    Step 2: Get the ascii values of all the extracted  alphabets.
                    Step 3: Calculate the sum of those ascii values, lets us call its as sum1 and calculate single digit sum for sum1(keep adding until you arrive single digit).
                    Step 4: Return the single digits as output.
                    
                    Note: 
                      1. Array size ranges from 1 to 15.
                      2. All the array elements are upper case alphabets.
                   
                   Example:
                        input1: {'A','B','C'}
                        input2: {'B','C'}
                        output: 65-->6+5=11-->1+1=2
                               so the output is 2.
