# CountTheVowels
This is a Program which I was faced in mettl test. This platform is more useful for testing by yourself. Mettl platform:Database Programmer Scoring. ... 
Mettl's flexible platform lets you thoroughly evaluate database programmers before making a hiring decision. Our hands-on assessments test candidate application of database queries by requiring them to match specific outputs

Program Description:
              Given a string Input1 which is a single word of length n(n ranges from 1 to 20). we have to find whether input1 contains all the vowels{a,e,i,o,u} in it and all of them occurs only once. 
              #If the both comditions satifies, you need to remove those Vowels from input1 and return the output as "NEW WORD WITHOUT VOWELS IN IT:LENGTH OF THE NEW WORD  
              #If any one of the vowels not found orr it occurs more than once,then return "REVERSED INPUT1:ERROR".
        
        #EXAMPLE-1:
                  INPUT1: cauliflower
                  OUTPUT: CLFLWR:6
        #EXAMPLE-2:
                  INPUT1: caesiious
                  OUTPUT: SUOIIEAC:ERROR
                  
                  
        NOTE:
            1. input1 is always single word with no spaces in it
            2. input1 will contains only lowercase alphabets
            3. output should be in uppercase.
