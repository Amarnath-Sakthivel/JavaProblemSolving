# DigitsOrChar
This is a Program which I was faced in mettl test. This platform is more useful for testing by yourself.   Mettl platform:Database Programmer Scoring. ... 
Mettl's flexible platform lets you thoroughly evaluate database programmers before making a hiring decision. Our hands-on assessments test candidate application of database queries by requiring them to match specific outputs.

ProgramDescription:
            Given a String Input1, having alphabets or digits or both, find the sum of digits or extract only the characters depending in Input2.
            Prototype DigitsOrChar(String input1,int input2)
            input1= String having alphabets or digits or both.
            input2= Either 0 or 1
                     if input2==1, find the sum of digits from string input1
                     else if input2==2, extract only alphabets from string input1
           NOTES:-
                 1. if NO DIGITS in input1 and input2==0,the result would be ZERO.
                 2. if NO ALPHABETS in input1 and input2==1,the result would be ZERO.
                 3. if String is NULL, the result would be NULL.
